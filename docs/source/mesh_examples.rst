Mesh Examples
=============

This section contains examples focused on mesh generation and geometry creation using CALFEM for Python's mesh module. These examples demonstrate how to create complex geometries, generate meshes, and visualize results.

These examples cover:

* **Basic geometry creation** - Creating simple and complex geometries
* **B-Splines and arcs** - Advanced geometric modeling
* **Mesh generation** - Creating finite element meshes
* **Boundary conditions** - Setting up markers and boundary conditions
* **Mesh refinement** - Controlling element density and quality
* **Visualization** - Displaying geometries and meshes

The mesh examples build upon each other, starting with basic concepts and progressing to more advanced techniques for creating and manipulating finite element meshes.
